# These are the architecture formats as used in release-packaging Jenkinsfile
# This is an ugly chimera, nobody uses this combination of dpkg and uname formats
# Why don't we pick one format and stick with it? Because at the time of writing
# it was deemed too risky/involving too many changes across repos to change architecture
# formats in release-packaging Jenkinsfile. But someone please do it.
# Why do we need to list this here? Because I haven't been able to figure out how
# to do Makefile rules with multiple patterns. (See how it's used in {deb,rpm}/Makefile)
# Adding new architectures or changing the format in release-packaging will prevent make
# from finding the corresponding rule unless this list is updated.
# Or Jenkinsfiles/Makefiles removed (ðŸŽµ Gotta have faith-a-faith-a-faith... ðŸŽµ)
